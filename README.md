## Deploying to GitHub Pages
This project contains a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and publishes the site to GitHub Pages whenever you push to `main`.

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. In your repository settings, enable **Pages** and select **GitHub Actions** as the source.
3. Update the `site` value in [`astro.config.mjs`](astro.config.mjs) so it matches your GitHub Pages URL (`https://<username>.github.io` or `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>`).
4. Commit and push your changes. The workflow will build the site and deploy it automatically.
